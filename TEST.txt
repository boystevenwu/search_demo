Milestone 3 Report

Student Name: Qian He (17337823), Steven Wu (10791134)
Version: Analyst

Highlights:

Thanks to the relatively small size of our data bank, query results can be found in less than 1ms according to the built-in timer library.
The tf-idf score was helpful in ranking the result, especially for common terms such as "ACM" and "machine learning."
We also realized that most "good" results come from detailed query contexts such as "computer science students" and specific search terms such as "Cristina Lopes."
Example Queries:
  machine learning
  ACM
  Cristina Lopes
  web crawler
  Richard Taylor
  information retrieval
  computer science students
  graduate programs


Improvements:

We firstly found that stopwords can impact the query result due to their high appearances: 
  Master of software engineering – because we didn’t give fewer weights to stopwords in the first place, the top results simply depend on how many times ‘of’   appears instead of the really important word like ‘master’, ‘software’, and ‘engineering’. We then decided to import a list of stopwords and eliminate them from tokenization when indexing.
  
  Information and Computer Science - and is a common name in English. Without lowering its weight, the search results will be influenced. The results became much better after we added different weights for stopwords.

However, it will bring another issue when the query contains only the stopwords:
  To be or not to be – since after we decided to distinguish the effects between stop-words and non-stop-words, we put 0 weights on stop-words. However, it turns out that this query will return 0 results. In the final design, we put fewer weights on stop-words instead of non-weights at all.

In the next step, we tried to generalize queries from typos and conjugations. 
We didn't find a very efficient way to correct user typos, so we decided to leave them as-is. 
In the case when users typed an incorrect word, they will likely not see good results:
  Acheive (Achieve) - No result.

As for conjugations, we used an external library for stemming the terms:
  Computers Science – should have more related results, but didn’t because the websites we have usually use the word “computer science” without an extra ‘s’.  Stemming makes ‘computer’ and ‘computers’ to be treated as the same word.

  Fishes – since the plural for fish is still ‘fish’, but some people might mistakenly write it as ‘fishes’. Stemming to make ‘fish and ‘fish to be treated as the same word.

  Learn – since before when we search ‘learn’, it doesn’t show any other related words such as ‘learning’. However, they represent the same thing. So, we added stemming to make ‘learn’ and ‘learning’ be treated as the same word.
  
  Artificial Intelligence -- It only shows the results with the extra word 'intelligence', but didn't show other very related words like 'intelligent'. So, we added stemming to make ‘Intelligence’ and ‘Intelligent’ be treated as the same word.

We also noticed that stemming can help reduce possible typoes but only searching for their stem portion:
  Professer (Professor) - will be stemmed to profess therefore, the typo won't affect the search results.
  
Con: Sometimes stemming would affect the real meaning of the query term:
  ICS - stemmed to 'ic' whose meaning is completely altered and can lead to confusion.

There are still issues that are unresolved. For queries that are too short, the results often come with low relevance.
  UCI - should have led to the overview page of the school but instead leads to some news page or other unrelated information.
  
  Informatics - lead to pages with low information value as informatics is a major name so student profile pages became the first in the rank.
